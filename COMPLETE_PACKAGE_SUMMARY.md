## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

A: No. Complete clean break. D2C messaging confuses new positioning.

**Q: What about old case studies?**
A: Delete or archive. Create new ones (from AI automation work).

**Q: Should we change the company name?**
A: No. Scalezix is fine. Just rebrand the messaging.

**Q: Timeline realistic?**
A: Yes. 5 weeks is standard for professional redesign of this scope.

**Q: What if we don't hit metrics?**
A: Data tells you what's wrong. CTA? Messaging? Audience targeting? Test and fix.
